# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure Nanodegree - Capstone Project: Azure Machine Learning Engineer

*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.

![Project workflow](./images/capstone-diagram.png)

## Project setup and installation

*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview

*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task

*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access

*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML

*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Automated ML results

*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remember to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter tuning

*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search

### Hyperparameter tuning results

*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remember to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model deployment

*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Demo

See [here](TBD) for a video demonstrating the project.

*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout suggestions

*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.

1. Convert your model to ONNX format. Your Jupyter notebook contains documentation and code for converting the model to the ONNX format.
2. Deploy your model to the Edge using Azure IoT Edge. Your submission includes an extra Jupyter notebook containing the code for deploying the model to the edge. The README file contains documentation about the deployment as well as screenshots showing the data arriving at your IoT hub. You can use this tutorial for reference.
3. Enable logging in your deployed web app. Can you log useful data about the requests being sent to the webapp? This may include, inference time, the time at which the request arrived, and other details. You can find out more about logging here. Your submission should contain code to perform logging in the deployed web app. Your README file also contains information about the details logged and a screenshot of the logs and metrics collected.

## Future work

- TBD
